##  User Tiers and Data Monetization

\!Forge offers two user tiers: Free and Premium.

  - **<span style="color: fabPrimary"> Free Users:</span>** Do not pay platform fees. Their project data may be sold by the platform (for FRGE tokens) to AI trainers, creating ongoing demand for FRGE. Free users pay for AI services in FIAT or TAO and can purchase marketplace content with FIAT or FRGE.

  - **<span style="color: fabAccent"> Premium Users:</span>** Pay a monthly subscription fee in FIAT for enhanced privacy; their project data is neither sold nor used for AI training. Premium users can also purchase marketplace content with FIAT or FRGE. Premium users can decide to sell their projects data to earn FRGE tokens when their data is used.

##  Token Utility

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Project Investment & Purchasing Power:</span>** FRGE tokens provide investors with purchasing power for projects created on the platform, enabling them to acquire projects that can be used to train their AI models

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Project Monetization:</span>** Premium users can sell their completed projects for FRGE tokens

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Bounty Payments:</span>** FRGE tokens can be used to pay for bounties on the platform

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Professional Services:</span>** Assembly and 3D printing professionals can accept FRGE as payment for their services

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Data Purchases:</span>** AI trainers and providers can purchase project data (from the platform or from premium users) using FRGE tokens, creating ongoing demand. **All FRGE earned from data sales is burned by the platform.**

##  Token Distribution

  - **<span style="color: fabPrimary"> Investors:</span>** 40% - For project investment and purchasing power

  - **<span style="color: fabAccent"> Team & Development:</span>** 20% - Vesting over 3 years

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Ecosystem Growth:</span>** 20% - For platform development and community incentives

  - **<span style="color: fabGrey"> Liquidity Pool:</span>** 20% - For FRGE/TAO liquidity

##  Payment Model

  - **<span style="color: fabPrimary"> Liquidity:</span>**
    
      - Liquidity is provided for FRGE/TAO trading pairs to ensure smooth conversion between tokens and to support a healthy marketplace.

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Marketplace Fees:</span>**
    
      - FIAT transactions: 15% platform fee
    
      - FRGE transactions: 5% platform fee (all burned)

##  Token Economics

  - **<span style="color: fabRed"> Total Supply:</span>** 100,000,000 FRGE

  - **<span style="color: fabAccent"> Raising:</span>** 20,000 TAO (approximately $8,770,000 at $438.50 per TAO)

**<span style="color: fabPrimary"> Formulas:</span>**

  - Premium users: \(N_{\text{premium}} = \frac{N_{\text{total}}}{7}\)

  - Free users: \(N_{\text{free}} = N_{\text{total}} \times \frac{6}{7}\)

  - FIAT income from premiums: \(I_{\text{premium}} = N_{\text{premium}} \times 150\)

  - AI usage fee income: \(I_{\text{AI}} = N_{\text{total}} \times 50 \times 0.15\)

  - Marketplace FIAT fee: \(I_{\text{mkt,FIAT}} = N_{\text{total}} \times 20 \times 0.15\)

  - Marketplace FRGE fee (burned): \(I_{\text{mkt,FRGE}} = N_{\text{total}} \times 5 \times 0.05\)

  - **Total FIAT income:** \(I_{\text{FIAT,tot}} = I_{\text{premium}} + I_{\text{AI}} + I_{\text{mkt,FIAT}}\)

  - **FIAT used to buy and burn FRGE:** \(B_{\text{FRGE,FIAT}} = I_{\text{premium}} \times 0.2\)

  - **FRGE burned (marketplace + data):** \(B_{\text{FRGE,direct}} = I_{\text{mkt,FRGE}} + N_{\text{free}}\)

  - **Total FRGE burned:** \(B_{\text{FRGE,tot}} = B_{\text{FRGE,FIAT}} + B_{\text{FRGE,direct}}\)
