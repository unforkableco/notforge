# Tokenomics



-----



The FRGE token is designed as a utility token that primarily serves as an investment vehicle and purchasing power for !Forge projects. Unlike traditional utility tokens, FRGE is not used for platform fees, governance, or AI service payments.

##  User Tiers and Data Monetization

!Forge offers two user tiers: Free and Premium.

  - ** Free Users:** Do not pay platform fees. Their project data may be sold by the platform (for FRGE tokens) to AI trainers, creating ongoing demand for FRGE. Free users pay for AI services in FIAT or TAO and can purchase marketplace content with FIAT or FRGE.

  - ** Premium Users:** Pay a monthly subscription fee in FIAT for enhanced privacy; their project data is neither sold nor used for AI training. Premium users can also purchase marketplace content with FIAT or FRGE. Premium users can decide to sell their projects data to earn FRGE tokens when their data is used.

##  Token Utility

  - ** Project Investment & Purchasing Power:** FRGE tokens provide investors with purchasing power for projects created on the platform, enabling them to acquire projects that can be used to train their AI models

  - ** Project Monetization:** Premium users can sell their completed projects for FRGE tokens

  - ** Bounty Payments:** FRGE tokens can be used to pay for bounties on the platform

  - ** Professional Services:** Assembly and 3D printing professionals can accept FRGE as payment for their services

  - ** Data Purchases:** AI trainers and providers can purchase project data (from the platform or from premium users) using FRGE tokens, creating ongoing demand. **All FRGE earned from data sales is burned by the platform.**

##  Token Distribution

  - ** Investors:** 40% - For project investment and purchasing power

  - ** Team & Development:** 20% - Vesting over 3 years

  - ** Ecosystem Growth:** 20% - For platform development and community incentives

  - ** Liquidity Pool:** 20% - For FRGE/TAO liquidity

##  Payment Model

  - ** FRGE Token:**

      - Used to purchase project data, marketplace content, and professional services

      - Demand is created by AI trainers and marketplace participants

  - ** TAO (Bittensor’s native token):**

      - Used for all AI-related services, including model training and inference

  - ** FIAT Currency:**

      - Used for premium subscriptions, AI services, and marketplace purchases



  - ** Liquidity:**

      - Liquidity is provided for FRGE/TAO trading pairs to ensure smooth conversion between tokens and to support a healthy marketplace.

  - ** Marketplace Fees:**

      - FIAT transactions: 15% platform fee

      - FRGE transactions: 5% platform fee (all burned)

##  Token Economics

  - ** Total Supply:** 100,000,000 FRGE

  - ** Raising:** 20,000 TAO (approximately $8,770,000 at $438.50 per TAO)

##  Deflationary Mechanism

To ensure long-term value and scarcity, !Forge incorporates multiple deflationary mechanisms:

  - 20% of premium subscription FIAT revenue is used to purchase and burn FRGE tokens

  - 5% fee from FRGE marketplace transactions is burned

  - All FRGE earned from data sales to AI trainers is burned

This multi-layered approach creates continuous buy pressure and deflationary effects on the FRGE token supply.

##  Use of Funds

These allocations are designed to maximize platform growth, user adoption, and long-term sustainability. 20% of premium subscription FIAT income creates consistent buy pressure on FRGE tokens, while the remaining 80% is strategically invested in platform development, AI capabilities, and user growth.

##  Projected Income

To illustrate the platform’s earning potential and the resulting FRGE buy and burn pressure, we project monthly income and FRGE demand as the user base grows from 1 to 20,000 users. The following assumptions are used:

  -  1 in 7 users is a premium user (\~14.3%), 6 in 7 are free users.

  -  Premium monthly fee: $150.

  -  All users spend $50/month on AI usage (platform takes 15% fee).

  -  All users spend $20/month on the marketplace in FIAT (15% fee) and $5/month in FRGE (5% fee, **all of which is burned**).

  -  20% of premium FIAT income is used to buy and burn FRGE.

  - ** AI trainers purchase data for $1/month in FRGE per free user** (\~6/7 of total users), **all of which is burned by the platform**.

** Formulas:**

  - Premium users: `N_{\text{premium}} = \frac{N_{\text{total}}}{7}`

  - Free users: `N_{\text{free}} = N_{\text{total}} \times \frac{6}{7}`

  - FIAT income from premiums: `I_{\text{premium}} = N_{\text{premium}} \times 150`

  - AI usage fee income: `I_{\text{AI}} = N_{\text{total}} \times 50 \times 0.15`

  - Marketplace FIAT fee: `I_{\text{mkt,FIAT}} = N_{\text{total}} \times 20 \times 0.15`

  - Marketplace FRGE fee (burned): `I_{\text{mkt,FRGE}} = N_{\text{total}} \times 5 \times 0.05`

  - **Total FIAT income:** `I_{\text{FIAT,tot}} = I_{\text{premium}} + I_{\text{AI}} + I_{\text{mkt,FIAT}}`

  - **FIAT used to buy and burn FRGE:** `B_{\text{FRGE,FIAT}} = I_{\text{premium}} \times 0.2`

  - **FRGE burned (marketplace + data):** `B_{\text{FRGE,direct}} = I_{\text{mkt,FRGE}} + N_{\text{free}}`

  - **Total FRGE burned:** `B_{\text{FRGE,tot}} = B_{\text{FRGE,FIAT}} + B_{\text{FRGE,direct}}`

| **Users** | **Premium Users** | **Free Users** | **Monthly FIAT** | **Monthly FRGE Burned** |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------------: | :---------------------: |
|   1,000   |        143        |      857       |     $21,428      |         $5,397          |
|   5,000   |        714        |     4,286      |     $107,143     |         $26,956         |
|  10,000   |       1,429       |     8,571      |     $214,286     |         $53,941         |
|  25,000   |       3,571       |     21,429     |     $535,714     |        $134,815         |

  - **Total FIAT Income** includes premium subscriptions, AI usage fees, and marketplace FIAT fees.

  - **FIAT Used to Buy & Burn FRGE** is the amount of FIAT from premium subscriptions used monthly to buy and burn FRGE (20%).

  - **FRGE Burned (Marketplace + Data)** includes the 5% fee on marketplace FRGE transactions plus the $1 per free user from data sales.

  - **Monthly FRGE Burned** is the total of all FRGE burning mechanisms combined.

  - At 20,000 users, approximately $108,000 worth of FRGE is burned monthly.
